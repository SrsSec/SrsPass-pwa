<p>{appTerm} is a stateless cryptographic password manager generating deterministic passwords backed by 128-bits of security.</p>
<p>In simpler terms; remember one password, and this app generates many secure passwords from it for all your accounts.</p>
<p>As it's stateless, there's no files/vaults to worry about. Your passwords are accessible to you, from any device.</p>
